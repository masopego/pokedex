# My Pokedex App 🎮
I love Pokemons too 🥁! So, I want to share my particular version of this Pokemon application with all my study partners. Come in, enjoy my code, and meet your favorite pokemons!
<br>
The **My Pokedex App** is an Android application that allows users to interact with a list of Pokémon. The app provides features such as viewing Pokémon from a Pokédex, capturing Pokémon, viewing detailed information about each Pokémon, and managing settings. Users can capture Pokémon and view their caught Pokémon, all using data retrieved from the public Pokémon API.

## ▶️ To start
It is time you could see your fav pokemons. I suggest you two essay ways to do it: 
-  Star by **cloning or downloading this project**. Remember to clean the project before start, and run "app":
    ```bash 
    git clone git@github.com:masopego/pokedex.git
  
My Pokedex App is now running at your emulator or your personal device
- Or go down or click here to see Pokemon's demo: [My Pokedex App](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/029581b1-f1e4-44ab-b91c-cd71bcb881c4)

**Let's My Pokedex's App play! 🎷**
** Have fun selecting your favorite Pokemons and learning more about their history.

## 🍒 Technologies Used

- Android (Java): The main platform for the app development.
- Firebase: Used to store user data and captured Pokémon in real-time.
- Retrofit: Library used for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the public Pokémon API.
- RecyclerView: Used to display lists of Pokémon in the Pokédex and captured Pokémon sections.
- ViewBinding: A feature used for binding views instead of using findViewById.
- Material Design: A modern design framework used to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- NavController: Used for navigating between fragments using Android’s Navigation Component.

 ##  🧑‍💻 Developer's Conclusions
This project allowed me to learn how to work with external APIs using Retrofit, store data in Firebase, and manage user authentication. One of the biggest challenges was integrating the Pokédex functionality, capturing Pokémon, and syncing with Firebase to reflect real-time changes. It was also exciting to implement a user-friendly interface optimized with Material Design.

The project structure also helped me understand the separation of concerns in an Android application, using Fragments and ViewModels to manage different aspects of the app.
